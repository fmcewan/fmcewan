Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a recent graduate with a degree in Computer Science and Mathematics. I'm passionate about building effective, scalable software and finding creative solutions to complex problems, especially where AI/ML and algorithms are concerned.

Currently, I'm focusing on deepening my knowledge of web frameworks such as React, as well as learning Python frameworks such as Django. I'm also actively seeking a graduate technology role where I can apply my skills.
