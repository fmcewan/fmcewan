Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a recent graduate with a degree in Computer Science and Mathematics. I'm passionate about building effective, scalable software and finding creative solutions to complex problems, especially where AI/ML and algorithms are concerned.

Currently, I'm focusing on deepening my knowledge of web frameworks such as React, as well as learning Python frameworks such as Django. I'm also actively seeking a graduate technology role where I can apply my skills.

### ðŸ’» My Tech Stack

I primarily work with Python and C++, and have experience with ML frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch. I'm currently gaining experience in web technologies such as React, and am also comfortable using tools like Docker and SQL.

### ðŸŒ± What I'm Currently Working On

I'm building my personal portfolio website ([https://www.fmcewan.dev](https://www.fmcewan.dev)) to host my projects in a more bespoke way. The main goal is to deepen my knowledge of web frameworks, particularly React, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS. Once there is a viable base to release, you'll be able to find the source code here on my profile.
